## Overview

- scripts in this folder contain the model used for the final prediction (aka the ENT predictor)
- scripts marked with draft were used earlier in development, and are no longer used. We highly recommend not using them

## Scripts

- random forest for IgG_PT prediction (`IgG_prediction_forest.py`)
- random forest for monocyte prediction (`monocyte_prediction_forest.py`)
- (deprecated) previous random forest predictor for monocytes (`monocyte_prediction_forest_draft.py`, `monocyte_prediction_forest_draft2.py`,`preliminary_testing.py`)

## TODO / Future Improvements

- add pre-trained predictor as seperate script (without parameter grid search) - ENT predictor
