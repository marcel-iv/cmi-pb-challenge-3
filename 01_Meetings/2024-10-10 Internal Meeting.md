# Agenda
1. Present findings from last time
2. Discussions
    - preferences for programming language / framework etc
    - choose a task to focus on
3. timeline going forward / tasks for next meeting

# Feature Selection
- MOFA: Multi-omics feature analysis

# Model Choice
- logistic regression
- naive-base classifier
- (multi-task) SVM
- random forest (tree swarm, block based)

# Language/Framework Choice
- scikit learn (python): basic, no NN/deep-learning, excellent tutorials, contains all interesting models

# Task Choice
1. IgG - main focus
2. Monocyte count (only when theres time remaining)
- ignore CCL3 and T cells for now

# Tasks for next meeting
- dimensionality reduction for transcriptome
- research on the limitatins of scikit learn for our data for a specific model
    - random forest (Raffael)
    - SVM (Glenn)
    - logistic regression/naive-base (Marci)
- ask for server infrastructure (Marci)
- R packages for PCA-like methods (Raffael)
- basic implementation for feature selection after next meeting
